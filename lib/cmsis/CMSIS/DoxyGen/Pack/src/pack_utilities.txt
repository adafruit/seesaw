\page createPackUtil Utilities for Creating Packs

Software Packs are ZIP files that contain a \ref packFormat "PDSC" file and other content, that is specified within the PDSC
file in XML. While the PDSC file can be created with any text editor, some of the contents have to be generated by
additional programs. Also, verification of a PDSC file requires the help of additional tools. This section gives and
overview over programs that are either part of the CMSIS Pack or are available for download on the Internet.
	- \subpage packChk is part of the CMSIS Pack and is used to check the validity of a PDSC file.
	- Validation of SVD files with <a href="../../SVD/html/svd_validate_file_pg.html"><b>SVDConv.exe</b></a> is required for SVD files that are part of \ref SWPackVariants "Device Family Packs".
	- Several \subpage cp_Editors can verify XML files using the XML schema files that are part of the CMSIS Pack.
	- \subpage cp_ZIPTool create the actual ZIP archive of a Software Pack.

/**
\page cp_Editors XML Editors

Some text editors are capable of verifying XML code against a schema file. This is helpful to identify syntactical or
structural problems in a PDSC or SVD file early in the development process. Useful editors are:
- <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a>
- <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio (Express)</a>

Usually, the XML file that is to be validated and its corresponding schema file need to reside in the same directory. The
CMSIS-Pack schema file \b Pack.xsd and the CMSIS-SVD schema file \b CMSIS-SVD.xsd are available in the directory
<b>.\\CMSIS\\Utilities</b> of the <b>ARM::CMSIS</b> Pack.

\page cp_ZIPTool ZIP Compression Tools

Any ZIP software utility supporting the compression method
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE" target="_blank">DEFLATE</a> can be used to create a Pack file. Simply, create
the ZIP file and rename it to *.pack.

The compression tool <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7-Zip</a> supports command line calls and can be
used in batch scripts like \ref cp_GeneratePack "gen_pack.bat" for automated Pack file creation (and verification
with \ref packChk). Installers for 7-Zip are available for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows operating systems.

The 'Blinky' project is a simple program for the LPC1857
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1800' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =           12.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =          180.00 MHz

 - Sys Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - LEDs are blinking with speed depending on SysTick timer interrupt period
 

The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  LPC1857 Flash:       configured for on-chip Flash
                       Valid Flash Signature is created with ElfDwT tool.
                       See "Options for Target" - "User")

  LPC1857 RAM:         runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                       (may be used for target debugging)

  LPC1857 Ext. Flash:  runs from NOR Flash located on board
                       (used for production or target debugging)
                       Set jumpers for boot pins to boot from External Flash
                       and press RESET button while holding down ISP button!

  LPC1857 SPIFI:       runs from SPIFI Flash located on board
                       Set jumpers for boot pins to boot from SPIFI
                       and press RESET button while holding down ISP button
                       (when on-chip Flash contains a valid image)!
